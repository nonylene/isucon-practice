;TI"%    %n - Newline character (\n)
;TI"!    %t - Tab character (\t)
;TI"&    %% - Literal ``%'' character
;TI"
;TI"  Combination:
;TI"-    %c - date and time (%a %b %e %T %Y)
;TI"    %D - Date (%m/%d/%y)
;TI"2    %F - The ISO 8601 date format (%Y-%m-%d)

;TI"#    %R - 24-hour time (%H:%M)
;TI"&    %T - 24-hour time (%H:%M:%S)
;TI"0    %+ - date(1) (%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y)
;TI"
;TI"OThis method is similar to strftime() function defined in ISO C and POSIX.
;TI"NSeveral directives (%a, %A, %b, %B, %c, %p, %r, %x, %X, %E*, %O* and %Z)
;TI"+are locale dependent in the function.
;TI"0However this method is locale independent.
;TI"MSo, the result may differ even if a same format string is used in other
;TI"systems such as C.
;TI"LIt is good practice to avoid %x and %X because there are corresponding
;TI"4locale independent representations, %D and %T.
