But in ;TI"Escenarios where large amounts of data need to be transferred it ;TI"Jmight be desirable to have some kind of streaming support available. ;TI"JFor example, huge OCTET STRINGs are preferably sent in smaller-sized ;TI"chunks, each at a time. ;TI"HThis is possible in BER by setting the length bytes of an encoding ;TI"Eto zero and by this indicating that the following value will be ;TI"Gsent in chunks. Infinite length encodings are always constructed. ;TI"FThe end of such a stream of chunks is indicated by sending a EOC ;TI"I(End of Content) tag. SETs and SEQUENCEs may use an infinite length ;TI"Fencoding, but also primitive types such as e.g. OCTET STRINGS or ;TI"CBIT STRINGS may leverage this functionality (cf. ITU-T X.690).;T:
