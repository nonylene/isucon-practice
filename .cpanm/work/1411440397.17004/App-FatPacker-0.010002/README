NAME
    App::FatPacker - pack your dependencies onto your script file

SYNOPSIS
      $ fatpack pack myscript.pl >myscript.packed.pl

    Or, with more step-by-step control:

      $ fatpack trace myscript.pl
      $ fatpack packlists-for `cat fatpacker.trace` >packlists
      $ fatpack tree `cat packlists`
      $ fatpack file myscript.pl >myscript.packed.pl

    See the documentation for the fatpack script itself for more
    information.

    The programmatic API for this code is not yet fully decided, hence the
    0.x release version. Expect that to be cleaned up for 1.0.

SUPPORT
    Your current best avenue is to come annoy mst on #toolchain on
    irc.perl.org. There should be a non-IRC means of support by 1.0.
