  * De-retardize XS-less behavior under SpeedyCGI
  * Test suite now works from within space-containing paths

0.05  Thu, 26 Apr 2012
  * Pure-perl implementation for situations where neither ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} nor
    XS are available

0.04  Sun, 03 Jul 2011 11:28:51 +0200
  * To detect a perl with ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}, check for the feature itself instead
    of a specific perl version (doy).
  * Update the documentation to reflect the use of ${^GLOBAL_PHASE} if available
    (doy).
  * Stop depending on Scope::Guard for the tests (doy).
  * Upgrade ppport.h from version 3.13 to 3.19.

0.03
  * Drop the XS code on perl versions recent enough to have ${^GLOBAL_PHASE}.
  * Drop code to support perls older than 5.6.  We've always been depending on
    5.6 anyway.
    + Use XSLoader without a fallback to DynaLoader.
    + Use our instead of use vars.
