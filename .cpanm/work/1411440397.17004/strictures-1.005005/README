NAME
    strictures - turn on strict and make all warnings fatal

SYNOPSIS
      use strictures 1;

    is equivalent to

      use strict;
      use warnings FATAL => 'all';

    except when called from a file which matches:

      (caller)[1] =~ /^(?:t|xt|lib|blib)/

    and when either ".git", ".svn", or ".hg" is present in the current
    directory (with the intention of only forcing extra tests on the author
    side) -- or when ".git", ".svn", or ".hg" is present two directories up
    along with "dist.ini" (which would indicate we are in a "dzil test"
    operation, via Dist::Zilla) -- or when the "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA"
    environment variable is set, in which case

      use strictures 1;

    is equivalent to

      use strict;
      use warnings FATAL => 'all';
      no indirect 'fatal';
      no multidimensional;
      no bareword::filehandles;

    Note that "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" may at some point add even more tests,
    with only a minor version increase, but any changes to the effect of
    "use strictures" in normal mode will involve a major version bump.

    If any of the extra testing modules are not present, strictures will
    complain loudly, once, via "warn()", and then shut up. But you really
    should consider installing them, they're all great anti-footgun tools.

DESCRIPTION
    I've been writing the equivalent of this module at the top of my code
    for about a year now. I figured it was time to make it shorter.

    Things like the importer in "use Moose" don't help me because they turn
    warnings on but don't make them fatal -- which from my point of view is
    useless because I want an exception to tell me my code isn't
    warnings-clean.

    Any time I see a warning from my code, that indicates a mistake.

    Any time my code encounters a mistake, I want a crash -- not spew to
    STDERR and then unknown (and probably undesired) subsequent behaviour.

    I also want to ensure that obvious coding mistakes, like indirect object
    syntax (and not so obvious mistakes that cause things to accidentally
    compile as such) get caught, but not at the cost of an XS dependency and
    not at the cost of blowing things up on another machine.

    Therefore, strictures turns on additional checking, but only when it
    thinks it's running in a test file in a VCS checkout -- although if this
    causes undesired behaviour this can be overridden by setting the
    "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" environment variable.

    If additional useful author side checks come to mind, I'll add them to
    the "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" code path only -- this will result in a
    minor version increase (e.g. 1.000000 to 1.001000 (1.1.0) or similar).
    Any fixes only to the mechanism of this code will result in a
    sub-version increase (e.g. 1.000000 to 1.000001 (1.0.1)).

    If the behaviour of "use strictures" in normal mode changes in any way,
    that will constitute a major version increase -- and the code already
    checks when its version is tested to ensure that

      use strictures 1;

    will continue to only introduce the current set of strictures even if
    2.0 is installed.

METHODS
  import
    This method does the setup work described above in "DESCRIPTION"

  VERSION
    This method traps the "strictures->VERSION(1)" call produced by a use
    line with a version number on it and does the version check.

EXTRA TESTING RATIONALE
    Every so often, somebody complains that they're deploying via "git pull"
    and that they don't want strictures to enable itself in this case -- and
    that setting "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" to 0 isn't acceptable (additional
    ways to disable extra testing would be welcome but the discussion never
    seems to get that far).

    In order to allow us to skip a couple of stages and get straight to a
    productive conversation, here's my current rationale for turning the
    extra testing on via a heuristic:

    The extra testing is all stuff that only ever blows up at compile time;
    this is intentional. So the oft-raised concern that it's different code
    being tested is only sort of the case -- none of the modules involved
    affect the final optree to my knowledge, so the author gets some
    additional compile time crashes which he/she then fixes, and the rest of
    the testing is completely valid for all environments.

    The point of the extra testing -- especially "no indirect" -- is to
    catch mistakes that newbie users won't even realise are mistakes without
    help. For example,

      foo { ... };

    where foo is an & prototyped sub that you forgot to import -- this is
    pernicious to track down since all *seems* fine until it gets called and
    you get a crash. Worse still, you can fail to have imported it due to a
    circular require, at which point you have a load order dependent bug
    which I've seen before now *only* show up in production due to tiny
    differences between the production and the development environment. I
    wrote <http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/indirect-but-still-fatal/> to
    explain this particular problem before strictures itself existed.

    As such, in my experience so far strictures' extra testing has *avoided*
    production versus development differences, not caused them.

    Additionally, strictures' policy is very much "try and provide as much
    protection as possible for newbies -- who won't think about whether
    there's an option to turn on or not" -- so having only the environment
    variable is not sufficient to achieve that (I get to explain that you
    need to add "use strict" at least once a week on freenode #perl --
    newbies sometimes completely skip steps because they don't understand
    that that step is important).

    I make no claims that the heuristic is perfect -- it's already been
    evolved significantly over time, especially for 1.004 where we changed
    things to ensure it only fires on files in your checkout (rather than
    strictures-using modules you happened to have installed, which was just
    silly). However, I hope the above clarifies why a heuristic approach is
    not only necessary but desirable from a point of view of providing new
    users with as much safety as possible, and will allow any future
    discussion on the subject to focus on "how do we minimise annoyance to
    people deploying from checkouts intentionally".
